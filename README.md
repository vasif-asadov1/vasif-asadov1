## About Me

I'm a data professional and M.Sc. candidate at Yıldız Technical University (Istanbul), building end-to-end data pipelines and ML solutions while completing a thesis on **AI-Based Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Systems**.

My background spans two scholarships — a **Presidential Scholarship from Azerbaijan** (ranked 1st nationally with a perfect 700/700 entrance score) and a **fully funded Turkish Government Scholarship** — giving me a strong academic foundation that I apply directly to real-world data problems.

I work across the full data stack: from raw ingestion and transformation to dashboards, predictive models, and deployed applications. I hold a **Microsoft PL-300 Power BI Data Analyst Associate** certification (valid through 2027) and have hands-on internship experience at **SOCAR R&D Institute** and **Data Science Academy**.

Beyond data, I use AI as a force multiplier for software development — I lead product vision and architecture, while AI handles lower-level implementation details. This lets me ship polished, full-featured desktop and web applications that would otherwise take months.

## Featured Projects

### 🏗️ E-commerce Cloud Analytics Pipeline
> *AWS S3 · Snowflake · dbt · Databricks · MLflow · Power BI*

End-to-end cloud data pipeline built on the **Olist e-commerce dataset**, structured around a full **medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold). Raw data is ingested from Kaggle into an S3 data lake, cleaned and transformed via dbt into a Snowflake warehouse, then surfaced to a Power BI executive dashboard. The ML layer (Databricks + MLflow) solves a multi-class classification problem — predicting customer review scores — with SHAP analysis for feature interpretability and A/B testing for statistical validation.

### 🏦 Home Credit Default Risk Analysis & Prediction
> *Python · DuckDB · XGBoost · LightGBM · SHAP*

Credit risk modeling on a **307,511-customer dataset** spanning 7+ relational tables (20M+ rows). The project involves deep multi-table EDA with 50+ structured business questions, extensive feature engineering (146 final features engineered from 250+ raw columns), and WoE encoding to handle high-cardinality categoricals. Final models: **LightGBM achieved 0.79 ROC-AUC and 0.696 Recall**. DuckDB was used throughout for fast out-of-core SQL processing.

### 📉 Customer Churn Prediction — Telecom
> *Python · Scikit-learn · XGBoost · LightGBM · Streamlit*

End-to-end ML pipeline predicting telecom customer churn. Includes Chi-Square and ANOVA-based feature selection, 9-model comparison baseline, hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV, and imbalance handling (SMOTE + undersampling). Deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web app** using sklearn Pipelines and ColumnTransformer. SHAP analysis on both Logistic Regression and XGBoost reveals that **tenure, contract type, and monthly charges** are the dominant churn drivers.

### 📊 B2C Sales Analysis — AdventureWorks DW
> *SQL Server · T-SQL · Tableau · Docker*

Full analytical workflow on the AdventureWorksDW2022 dataset, scoped exclusively to B2C sales. Stood up SQL Server in a Docker container on Linux, restructured the schema into an 11-table star schema, and answered 23 business questions spanning executive KPIs, customer segmentation, product profitability, geographic distribution, and SLA adherence. Published an executive **Tableau dashboard** with a dynamic KPI parameter allowing stakeholders to toggle between Revenue, Cost, Profit, and Order Count across all visuals.

### 📦 pysqdb — PyPI Package
> *Python · DuckDB · GitHub Actions*

Open-source Python library published on **PyPI** (`pip install pysqdb`) that wraps DuckDB with a Pandas-like declarative API. Provides zero-copy views, SQL-native imputation, outlier handling, multi-table joins via Python dicts, window functions, and aggregation pipelines — all designed for large datasets that exceed RAM. CI/CD via **GitHub Actions** automates testing and publishing on every release.
